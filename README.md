# Space Invadders

## Description

Space Invadders is a trivia variant of the popular retro arcade game Space Invaders. The game utilizes a challenge engine to intertwine a beloved classic with various problem solving challenges. The purpose of the game is to help children who struggle to pay attention in an orthodox classroom environment improve simple problem solving skills. The project makes use of both the MVC & Entity-Component paradigms. The game uses touch controls to allow the user to move left/right and shoot and pseudo-random number generators to create enemy behavior.
